          <p class="para"><strong> About Me:</strong> Hey, am Murad Guliyev.  In 2003 I was born and live in Baku.  Studied at the Baku Avropean Lyceum.  During my school years, my favorite subject was mathematics.  I went to Olympiads in Mathematics and Informatics, took 2nd place in the State Olympiad in Informatics, several times performed with a project at the Baku Expo Center in front of the ministers of education of Azerbaijan.  Since my school days, I have been fond of robotics and participated in fll, where our team won first place and we represented our country in Estonia.  After that I was elected as the jury of the Olympiad in Baku.  I am currently studying at Ada at the Faculty of Information Technology and working as a robotics teacher at Azerobot.  I really like everything related to numbers, technology and innovation.  Therefore, I chose this faculty for myself and I hope to graduate from the university with high results and enroll in a master abroad.  After graduation, I want to become a business analyst and develop in this business.</p>

          <p class="para">This site was created by the Candy codes team. This was our task from a respected Dr. Araz Yusubov. Prior to the start of our work, we had no idea about the creator of the site.  Our team members with the help of our group leader we came to an idea of how to develop it. But with the help of code.org and other useful guides, we learned how to do it. We were able to make it happen.

        <p class="para h-o-c-p">We made advance plans to ensure that our students have a successful day: 1. Go through the Hour of Code educator's manual. 2. Registering our event through Hour of Code. Every school that registers gets acknowledged, and doing so enables Code.org to monitor the results. 3. Choosing a few lessons or exercises and testing them out throughout the course of the entire week. This stage, in our perspective, enabled us to help students make connections to prior classes, comprehend how to promote learning, and foresee where some of them could get stuck. 4. Modified any of Code.org's courses or exercises to meet the demands of our class.We're trying to persuade youngsters that the Hour of Code may be the start of their coding and programming journey and that they should focus on some of the fundamental concepts that are crucial to programming in any programming language. Students will learn the basics of input, output, loops, and functions.</p>
